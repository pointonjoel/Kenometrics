# Kenometrics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Kenometrics is to provide a set of functions which allow econometrics students to simply conduct important manipulations and tests.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Kenometrics from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Kenometrics")
```
To install the latest development version from GitHub:

install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pointonjoel/Kenometrics")

## Overview

The Kenometrics package enables lecturers and students to teach and implement fundemental econometric techniques. Below is a summary of the functions on offer and how they can be used:
1. get_data() A single function to find and source data from a variety of sources (Wooldridge, FRED, txt, Excel)
2. ttest() Conduct a t-test (with a specific hypothesised mean, not necessarily 0)
3. make_ts() Make the data time-series (to allow for lagged variables etc.)
4. chow() Conduct a chow test (it adds an intercept and dummy slope and tests the significance depending on if we are testing for a break in the intercept, slope or both)
5. ADF() Conduct an ADF test (and if the data are non stationary, it adds the first-difference to the data frame)
6. LRM() Find and test the significance of the long run multiplier

## Example
When importing data, students may often be overwhelmed with the specifics needed when importing from a variety of sources. Whilst the Wooldridge package allows for importing datasets from the [Introductory Econometrics textbook](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/Introductory-Econometrics-by-Jeffrey-M-Wooldridge-author/9781305270107), having one function complete with FRED and Excel integration simplies things further. 

To import data to the current environment, simply specify the name of the file/dataset and the type of data.

```{r example}
library(Kenometrics)
source_data("hseinv", woolridge)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
